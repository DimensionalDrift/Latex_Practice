It was a <adjective> Halloween night. As I was <verb>ing down the street, a <adjective>  monster that looked like  a <adjective>  <noun_1> <verb>ed out from behind a bush. `<exclamation>, you <verb>ed me!' `Sorry' said the <noun_1>. `I'm in a rush to get to the <noun> so that I can get Halloween <noun_2>.' He was a monster but I thought that Halloween <noun_2> sounded really good so I followed the <adjective>  monster. We ran <adverb> all the way down the street, through a <noun> and over a <noun>, only to find that there was no Halloween <noun_2>. It just goes to show you that you should not trust a <adjective> monster on Halloween!
