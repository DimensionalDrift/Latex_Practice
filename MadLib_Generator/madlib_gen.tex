It was a frightened Halloween night. As I was walking down the street, a silly  monster that looked like  a terrifying  ogre burned out from behind a bush. `Argh, you tottered me!' `Sorry' said the ogre. `I'm in a rush to get to the broom so that I can get Halloween cat.' He was a monster but I thought that Halloween cat sounded really good so I followed the scary  monster. We ran sadly all the way down the street, through a witch and over a grave, only to find that there was no Halloween cat. It just goes to show you that you should not trust a bizarre monster on Halloween!
