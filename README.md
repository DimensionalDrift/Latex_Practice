# Latex_Practice
Some practice projects involving automating the generation of Latex documents using Python

## Latex_Basics
This folder contains a sample Latex file that has the most basic examples of Latex elements such as a title, section, table and an image.

## MadLib_Generator
This folder contains an example of automating the generation of Latex documents using Python. A Latex template that contains placeholders is imported into a Python script where the placeholders are replaced randomly with words from a list of nouns, adjectives, etc. The new Latex document is then saved and built to make a mad lib style story about Halloween.

## Payslip_Generator
This folder contains another example of automating the generation of Latex documents using Python. Payslips are generated from a database of employees working hours where simple calculations are done to calculate the tax amount due and the net pay. A payslip is generated for each employee in the database and saved to a folder. An example of a payslip that was used as the model for the latex ones can be found with the rest of the employees slips.
